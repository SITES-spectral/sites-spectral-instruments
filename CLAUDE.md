#### Key Components
- **Authentication System**: `src/auth.js` with JWT tokens and role-based permissions
- **Database Schema**: Normalized design with proper relationships
- **Modal CRUD Forms**: Comprehensive forms for stations, platforms, instruments
- **Interactive Maps**: Permission-based map data with role-specific views

### üîê Authentication System

#### JWT Token Management
```javascript
// Token verification
const user = await getUserFromRequest(request);
if (!user) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Authentication required' }), {
        status: 401,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
}

// Permission checking
if (!hasPermission(user, 'write', 'instruments', stationId)) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Insufficient permissions' }), {
        status: 403,
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
}
```

#### Default Admin User
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin` (should be changed on first login)
- **Role**: `admin`
- **Access**: Full system access

#### Session Management
- JWT tokens stored in localStorage
- Automatic token verification on page load
- Session tracking in `user_sessions` table
- Activity logging for audit compliance

### üìä Database Schema Guide

#### Core Tables
- **`stations`**: Research station master data
- **`platforms`**: Physical mounting structures
- **`instruments`**: Phenocams and sensors with full specifications
- **`users`**: User accounts with role-based access
- **`user_field_permissions`**: Granular field-level permissions
- **`activity_log`**: Complete audit trail

#### Key Relationships
```sql
stations (1) -> (*) platforms -> (*) instruments
users (1) -> (*) user_sessions
users (*) -> (1) stations (for station users)
```

#### Permission System
- **Field-level control**: Different users can edit different fields
- **Station isolation**: Station users see only their assigned station
- **Role inheritance**: Admin users have all permissions

### üéØ CRUD Operations

#### Modal Form System
All CRUD operations use professional modal forms with:
- **Tabbed Organization**: Logical grouping of related fields
- **Field Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Contextual Help**: Tooltips and instructions throughout
- **Role-Aware**: Different fields available based on user permissions

#### Station Management
```javascript
// Edit station (admin only)
async function editStation(stationId) {
    const station = await fetchStationData(stationId);
    populateStationForm(station);
    showModal('station-modal');
}
```

#### Platform Management
```javascript
// Platform with mounting structure details
const platformData = {
    display_name: "Abisko Forest Building 01",
    mounting_structure: "Building RoofTop",
    platform_height_m: 15.5,
    latitude: 68.3629,
    longitude: 18.7985
};
```

#### Instrument Management
```javascript
// Comprehensive instrument configuration
const instrumentData = {
    display_name: "Abisko Forest Phenocam 01",
    ecosystem_code: "FOR",
    camera_brand: "Mobotix",
    camera_model: "M16B",
    camera_resolution: "4096x3072",
    first_measurement_year: 2010,
    measurement_status: "Active"
};
```

### üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Mapping

#### Permission-Based Data Loading
```javascript
// Load map data based on user permissions
const response = await fetch('/api/geojson/all', {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
});
```

#### Marker System
- **Station Markers**: Blue broadcast tower icons
- **Platform Markers**: Green tower icons
- **Phenocam Markers**: Camera icons
- **Sensor Markers**: Microscope icons

## Important Notes for Development

1. **Security First**: All operations must check authentication and permissions
2. **User Experience**: Provide clear instructions and feedback at every step
3. **Data Integrity**: Validate all inputs and maintain referential integrity
4. **Performance**: Use efficient queries and minimize API calls
5. **Documentation**: Keep this file updated as features evolve

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New User Role
1. Update `user_field_permissions` table with role permissions
2. Add role handling in `src/auth.js` permission functions
3. Update UI to show/hide features based on role
4. Add role-specific instructions in `setupRoleInstructions()`

### Adding New Form Field
1. Add field to database schema via migration
2. Add field to appropriate modal form in `stations.html`
3. Update form population and save functions
4. Add field permissions to `user_field_permissions` table
5. Update validation logic in API handlers

### Testing CRUD Operations
1. Test as admin user: should see all stations and have full edit rights
2. Test as station user: should see only assigned station with edit rights
3. Test as readonly user: should see data but no edit buttons
4. Verify all form validations work correctly
5. Check that activity logging captures all changes

This system prioritizes security, usability, and comprehensive audit trails suitable for research institution requirements.
- update the version number, changelog, documentation, when successfully tested, troubleshooted fixed  and done. Then commit, push and deploy
- The authentication system uses Cloudflare secrets, not database credentials
- use station-credentials-SECURE.json to login using the cloudflare credentials
