**üîó Worker URL:** https://sites-spectral-instruments.jose-e5f.workers.dev
**üìÖ Deployment Date:** 2025-09-26 ‚úÖ DEPLOYED v4.9.5 üîí
**üéØ Major Achievement:** Implemented strict role-based access control and fixed critical JavaScript syntax errors

### üîí Enhanced Role-Based Access Control in v4.9.5
- **Dashboard Access Restriction**: Only admin users can access `/dashboard.html` - all other users are redirected appropriately
- **Station User Isolation**: Station users can only access their assigned station page, cannot reach dashboard
- **Readonly User Restriction**: Readonly users no longer have dashboard access, redirected to login
- **Login Redirect Logic**: Updated to properly route users based on role (admin ‚Üí dashboard, station ‚Üí station page, others ‚Üí login)
- **Station Page Security**: Fixed redirect logic to prevent non-admin users from accessing dashboard

### üêõ Critical JavaScript Fixes in v4.9.5
- **Leaflet Script Tag**: Fixed malformed script tag missing closing `>` that caused "unexpected token: '{'" syntax error
- **Demo Data Removal**: Removed all hardcoded demo platform data since application now works with database
- **Syntax Validation**: Verified all HTML pages have balanced braces and parentheses
- **Script Validation**: Ensured proper HTML structure and JavaScript parsing across all pages

### üöÄ Security Improvements in v4.9.5
- **Multi-Layer Protection**: Added both client-side and server-side role validation
- **Access Prevention**: Dashboard prevents unauthorized access with immediate redirect
- **Role Enforcement**: Consistent role checking across login, dashboard, and station pages
- **User Experience**: Seamless redirects maintain user flow while enforcing security
