- **Status Indicators**: Loading spinners, success notifications, and comprehensive error messaging

### üìã API Endpoints Added in v4.9.0
- **`POST /api/stations`**: Create new station with validation and conflict resolution (admin only)
- **`PUT /api/stations/{id}`**: Enhanced station editing including normalized name modifications (admin only)
- **`DELETE /api/stations/{id}`**: Station deletion with cascade analysis and backup generation (admin only)
- **`POST /api/platforms`**: Create new platform with smart naming and validation (admin only)
- **`DELETE /api/platforms/{id}`**: Platform deletion with dependency checking and backup (admin only)

### üîß Advanced Technical Implementation in v4.9.0
- **Helper Functions**: `generateAlternativeNormalizedName()` and `generateNextLocationCode()` for conflict resolution
- **Backup Architecture**: Comprehensive data preservation with metadata tracking and download functionality
- **Form Validation**: Multi-layer validation with client-side checks and server-side enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management with user-friendly messages and recovery suggestions
- **Database Integration**: Proper cascade handling and foreign key constraint management

## Current System Architecture

### Authentication System
- **Role-Based Access**: Three user roles (admin, station, readonly) with granular permissions
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with session management
- **Permission Matrix**: Field-level permissions controlled via `user_field_permissions` table

### Database Schema
- **Core Tables**: `stations`, `platforms`, `instruments`, `instrument_rois`
- **User Management**: `users`, `user_sessions`, `activity_log`
- **Normalized Design**: Proper relationships with foreign key constraints
- **Migration System**: Structured database evolution with numbered migrations

### Key Features
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Full create/read/update/delete for all entities
- **Interactive Mapping**: Leaflet-based maps with permission-filtered data
- **Professional UI**: Responsive design with comprehensive modal systems
- **ROI Management**: Complete Region of Interest functionality with visual editing
- **Export Capabilities**: Multi-format data export with filtering options

### Development Commands

#### Build and Development
```bash
npm run dev                 # Start local development server
npm run build              # Build application with version bump
npm run build:bump         # Build with automatic version increment
```

#### Database Operations
```bash
npm run db:migrate         # Apply migrations to remote database
npm run db:migrate:local   # Apply migrations to local database
npm run db:studio          # Open database studio interface
```

#### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy             # Build and deploy to production
npm run deploy:bump        # Build with version bump and deploy
```

#### Database Management
```bash
# Execute migrations
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply spectral_stations_db --remote

# Query database
npx wrangler d1 execute spectral_stations_db --remote --command="SELECT * FROM stations;"
```

### Security Best Practices
- **No Public Access**: All functionality requires user authentication
- **Input Sanitization**: All user input validated and sanitized
- **Permission Enforcement**: Server-side validation of all permissions
- **Activity Logging**: Complete audit trail for compliance
- **Session Security**: Secure JWT token management

### Ecosystem Codes
All 12 official ecosystem codes are supported:
- **HEA** - Heathland
- **AGR** - Arable Land
- **MIR** - Mires
- **LAK** - Lake
- **WET** - Wetland
- **GRA** - Grassland
- **FOR** - Forest
- **ALP** - Alpine Forest
- **CON** - Coniferous Forest
- **DEC** - Deciduous Forest
- **MAR** - Marshland
- **PEA** - Peatland

### Important Notes for Development

1. **Security First**: All operations must check authentication and permissions
2. **User Experience**: Provide clear instructions and feedback at every step
3. **Data Integrity**: Validate all inputs and maintain referential integrity
4. **Performance**: Use efficient queries and minimize API calls
5. **Documentation**: Keep this file updated as features evolve
