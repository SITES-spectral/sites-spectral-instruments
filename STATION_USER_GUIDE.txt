# SITES Spectral Instruments Database - Station User Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the SITES Spectral Instruments Database! This system allows you to view and update information about platforms and instruments at your assigned research station. This guide will help you navigate the system and make necessary updates to keep our database current and accurate.

## Getting Started

### Login
1. Visit the SITES Spectral Instruments portal at https://sites.jobelab.com
2. Enter your assigned username and password
3. You will be automatically directed to your station's dashboard

### Your Dashboard
Once logged in, you'll see:
- **Station Overview**: General information about your research station
- **Platform Cards**: Visual cards showing all platforms at your station
- **Instrument Cards**: Detailed cards for each phenocam and sensor
- **Interactive Map**: Geographic view of your station's infrastructure

## Understanding the Data Structure

### Normalized Names vs Legacy Names
- **Normalized Names**: New standardized naming convention (e.g., `ANS_FOR_BL01_PHE01`)
  - Format: `[STATION]_[ECOSYSTEM]_[PLATFORM]_[INSTRUMENT]`
  - These are the official identifiers going forward
- **Legacy Names**: Previous naming conventions still displayed for reference
  - Marked with "legacy name:" prefix in the interface
  - Maintained for historical continuity
