# This file defines the different types of platforms that can host instruments.
# Platforms are physical structures or vehicles that carry measurement equipment.
# =============================================================================

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FIXED PLATFORMS
# Permanent installations such as towers, buildings, or mounting structures
# that remain stationary and provide long-term continuous measurements.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
fixed:
  name: "Fixed Platform"
  description: "Permanent installation on towers, buildings, or other fixed structures for continuous long-term monitoring."
  icon: "fa-tower-observation"
  color: "#2563eb"

  # Instruments that can be mounted on fixed platforms
  supported_instruments:
    - phenocam
    - multispectral
    - par_sensor
    - ndvi_sensor
    - pri_sensor
    - hyperspectral

  # Location is required for fixed platforms
  requires_location: true

  # Fixed platforms do not require Area of Interest definition
  requires_aoi: false

  # Additional metadata about this platform type
  help_text: "Use this for permanent installations like flux towers, meteorological stations, or building-mounted cameras."

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# UAV PLATFORMS
# Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) that carry sensors for spatial surveys
# and can capture data over larger areas with flexible timing.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
uav:
  name: "UAV Platform"
  description: "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (drone) for flexible spatial surveys and airborne measurements."
  icon: "fa-helicopter"
  color: "#059669"

  # Instruments commonly mounted on UAVs
  supported_instruments:
    - phenocam
    - multispectral
    - hyperspectral
    - thermal
    - lidar

  # UAVs have a launch/base location but fly over areas
  requires_location: true

  # UAV missions require defining the survey area
  requires_aoi: true

  # Additional metadata about this platform type
  help_text: "Use this for drone-based surveys. Requires defining the Area of Interest (AOI) that the UAV will cover."

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SATELLITE PLATFORMS
# Space-based observation platforms that provide regional to global coverage
# with regular revisit intervals.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
satellite:
  name: "Satellite Platform"
  description: "Space-based observation platform for regional coverage and systematic temporal sampling."
  icon: "fa-satellite"
  color: "#7c3aed"

  # Instruments available on satellite platforms
  supported_instruments:
    - multispectral
    - hyperspectral
    - thermal
    - radar

  # Satellites orbit - no single location, but we track ground coverage
  requires_location: false

  # Satellite data always relates to a ground area
  requires_aoi: true

  # Additional metadata about this platform type
  help_text: "Use this for satellite-derived data products. Requires defining the Area of Interest (AOI) on the ground."
