# SITES Spectral Mount Types - Extended Vocabulary
# Normalized to consistent 3-letter codes (v12.0.0 - BREAKING CHANGE)
# Standard vocabulary mappings added for ICOS/Copernicus interoperability
# Version: 12.0.0
#
# v12.0.0 Changes (BREAKING):
#   - PL -> TWR (Tower/Mast - standard aviation/infrastructure abbreviation)
#   - BL -> BLD (Building - common abbreviation)
#   - GL -> GND (Ground - standard abbreviation)
#   - All mount type codes now consistently 3 letters
#   - Platform and instrument normalized_name values updated
